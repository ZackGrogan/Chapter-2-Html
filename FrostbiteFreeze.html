<h3>The results are in</h3>

<p>257 runners braved the -10  weather on January 19 and ran, in one fashion 
or another, the icy 5-kilometer course through downtown Butte. About half 
the runners sported costumes rather than serious running gear, and many 
runners posted good times (costumed or not). For many, this was the season’s 
first run (not race – run), a motivational warm-up for the fun and work that 
lies ahead.

Awards were given for best time in four age categories for both sexes.
